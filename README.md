## Getting Started

You're gonna need an .env file. You can copy the example file and fill in the blanks.

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

You will also need to push and seed the database. You can do this by running `npm run seed`.

After that you can run the project in developer mode with `docker-compose up`.

If you need to rebuild your docker image after that you can run `docker-compose up --build`.
